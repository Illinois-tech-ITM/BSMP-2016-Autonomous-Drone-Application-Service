Using this file to add comments about the code.

Steps/problem I went through (Kae):
1. To use the location api, it's required to ask the user's permission to use the location info:
  • add uses-permission on manifest.xml
  • to previous APIs (below 20 if I'm not wrong), it's required to request permission at run time - see the code for 
    "checkLocationPermissions"
2. Compability among APIs:
  • <uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="15" android:targetSdkVersion="23" /> - adds compability
  • @TargetApi(Build.VERSION_CODES.M) - supresses complains about features of APIs that are newer than minSdkVersion
3. Using the location api (via google APIs):
  • compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services:9.0.2' -  added on the app gradle file within dependencies
4. Tests on previous API:
  • the current app is not running on 4.1
